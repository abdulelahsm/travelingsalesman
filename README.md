# The travelling salesman problem (TSP)
The travelling salesman problem asks the following question: "Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city and returns to the origin city?" 

It is an NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization, important in operations research and theoretical computer science.

The code file contains a construction heuristics for the TSP and an improvement heuristics for a previously constructed solution, local search, and random-start local search.
